<p>The Palazzo Comunale of Bologna, originally the residence of the jurist Accursio and expanded over the centuries, has long served as the city’s seat of government. 
Renovated in the 15th century and enriched by papal interventions from the 16th century onward, it preserves important works such as the Madonna with Child by Niccolò dell’Arca 
and the statue of Pope Gregory XIII. Inside, notable spaces include the Council Chamber, the Legate’s Chapel (where Charles V was crowned), and the Sala Farnese, 
decorated with significant painting cycles. Today the palace also houses the Civic Art Collections and the Morandi Museum.</p>
