<p>The <a href="https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/archivio/luoghi/palazzo-daccursio">Palazzo d'Accursio</a> of Bologna, originally the residence of the jurist Accursio 
and expanded over the centuries, has long served as the city’s seat of government. Renovated in the 15th century and enriched by papal interventions from the 16th century onward, 
it preserves important works such as the <a href="https://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda/opera/76412/Niccol%C3%B2%20dell%27Arca%2C%20Madonna%20con%20Bambino
">Madonna with Child by Niccolò dell’Arca</a> and the <a href="https://www.doc.mode.unibo.it/documenti/la-statua-di-gregorio-xiii-su-palazzo-daccursio-bologna
">statue of Pope Gregory XIII</a>. Inside, notable spaces include the <a href="https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/sites/default/files/2024-01/palazzo-daccursioita-low.pdf 
">Sala Farnese</a>, decorated with significant painting cycles. Today, the palace also houses the <a href="https://www.museibologna.it/schede/collezioni-comunali-d-arte-741/ 
">Civic Art Collections</a> and the <a href="https://www.museibologna.it/morandi/
">Morandi Museum</a>.</p>
<p>Palazzo d’Accursio is already part of ArCo, the Italian knowledge graph for cultural heritage. Through RDF descriptions and OWL-based ontologies, 
ArCo makes cultural data accessible in a structured, machine-readable way. Yet, the story of the palace can be told in even richer detail, 
adding layers that make it easier to explore, understand, and share in both educational and digital environments.</p>

<p>In this project, we use Palazzo d’Accursio as a case study to see how Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) 
can bring cultural heritage to life. By combining historical sources with semantic technologies, we aim to identify 
what is still missing from existing knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>As Bologna’s historic seat of government and a wonderful piece of art and architecture, Palazzo d’Accursio is an ideal candidate for this kind of digital experimentation. 
Its halls, frescoes, and symbolic role in the city show how powerful an enriched digital presence can be, not only for researchers 
but also for anyone curious to discover and connect with cultural heritage.</p>
