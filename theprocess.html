<p>We noticed that the ArCo entry for Palazzo d’Accursio is missing many details about the artistic heritage found in its various rooms. 
To begin enriching this information, we focused on the presence of frescoes within the palace. 
For this task, we employed large language models (LLMs), using a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting approach to identify and retrieve relevant content.</p>


<h3> FEW-SHOT CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING TECHNIQUE </h3>

<p>I will give you some examples of Italian palaces, followed by the year in which they were built and a few examples of the main frescoes present inside them. <br>
Ex. 1:  <br>
Palace: Castello Estense of Ferrara <br>
Year: 1385 <br>
Frescoes: Sala dei Giochi (Hall of Games) --> Decorated in the 16th century with frescoes of playful and mythological scenes, created for the Este court’s entertainment. <br>
Camerini di Alfonso I d’Este --> Though many of the original artworks were later dispersed, the small private rooms of Duke Alfonso I were richly decorated with frescoes and paintings 
by great artists, including Dosso Dossi and other Ferrara school painters. <br>
Cappella Ducale (Ducal Chapel) --> Contains religious fresco decoration, designed to serve the spiritual needs of the Este family within the castle. <br>
Sala dell’Aurora --> Frescoes depicting mythological and allegorical themes, painted during the 16th century. <br>
Sala dei Paesaggi (Hall of Landscapes) --> Frescoed walls with panoramic views of imaginary cities and countryside, typical of the Ferrarese Renaissance taste for illusionistic decoration. <br>
<br>
Ex.2 <br>
Palace: Rocchetta Mattei of Bologna <br>
Year: 1850 <br>
Frescoes: Scala delle Visioni (Staircase of Visions) --> This symbolic staircase leads to the upper tower and is adorned with an allegorical fresco in the vault, 
representing the triumph of Mattei's electrohomeopathy over traditional medicine. <br>
Sala della Musica (Music Hall) --> Inspired by the Cathedral of Córdoba, this room features intricate frescoes that complement its Moorish architectural elements. <br>
Cappella (Chapel) --> The chapel, modeled after the Mezquita of Córdoba, showcases frescoes that harmonize with its distinctive black-and-white striped arches and Islamic-inspired design . <br>
Cortile dei Leoni (Courtyard of the Lions) --> While primarily known for its architectural features, this area also includes decorative elements that contribute to the castle's artistic ambiance. <br>
<br>
Now think step by step and give the answers of the following case using the same style: <br>
