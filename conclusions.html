<p>In conclusion, we can say that <strong>Arco</strong> is an excellent knowledge graph from which to retrieve information about historical and cultural assets. 
The entry on Palazzo d'Accursio already provides numerous details and curiosities related to its architecture and history; 
however, it is more lacking when it comes to its interior spaces and decorations.</p> 
<p><strong>Large Language Models</strong> have greatly aided us in extracting additional information 
about the palace and in creating new triples that connect this information to the Palazzo d'Accursio. Nonetheless, artificial intelligences are not always accurate in their responses 
and may generate actual hallucinations, which highlights the importance of human verification and correction. It is also important for humans to be able to craft effective prompts 
and to know how to choose the best prompting technique depending on the specific case.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> has proven to be an efficient and easy-to-understand platform for 
non-expert users, as well as for creating a simple yet well-structured website.</p>
