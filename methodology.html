<p>To carry out our project, we first checked whether Palazzo d’Accursio was already represented in ArCo. After retrieving its IRI, 
we explored its ontology to gather all the information currently available in the knowledge graph.</p>

<p>Next, we conducted further research on the palace by consulting reliable sources and asking questions to AI models. 
The answers provided by the LLMs were carefully verified against trustworthy references. Through this process, we identified the main gaps in ArCo’s data: 
while the knowledge graph contains extensive information on the palace’s architecture, history, location, and current use, it lacks details about its interior treasures, 
such as the various rooms, statues, and frescoes.</p>

<p>Once the gaps were identified, we created new RDF triples with the support of <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, 
<a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat?q=">Mistral</a>, and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini.</a>. These triples were then reviewed and, 
when necessary, manually corrected to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally, after collecting and organizing all the information, we built a website using GitHub, presenting our findings in a clear and structured way. 
This project not only enriches ArCo’s representation of Palazzo d’Accursio but also provides a user-friendly platform for exploring the palace’s artistic and historical highlights.</p>
